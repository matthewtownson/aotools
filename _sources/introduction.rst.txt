Introduction
============

AOtools is an attempt to gather together many common tools, equations and functions for Adaptive Optics.
The idea is to provide an alternative to the current model, where a new AO researcher must write their own library
of tools, many of which implement theory and ideas that have been in existance for over 20 years. AOtools will hopefully
provide a common place to put these tools, which through use and bug fixes, should become reliable and well documented.

Installation
------------
AOtools uses mainly standard library functions, and all attempts have been made to avoid adding unneccessary dependencies.
Currently, the library requires only

- numpy
- scipy
- astropy
- matplotlib
